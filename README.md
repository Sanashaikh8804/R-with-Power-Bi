1. Chart: State, Sales and Discount
üß© What the code does:
Categorizes transactions based on whether a discount was applied (With Discount vs Without Discount).
Calculates the average sales for each state under both categories.
Compares the difference in average sales to see where discounts were most effective.
Displays the top 5 states where discounts led to the highest increase in sales using a horizontal bar chart.

SCRIPT:
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Use the dataset provided by Power BI
sales <- dataset

# Step 1: Create a new column for discount category
state_discount_analysis <- sales %>%
  mutate(discount_given = ifelse(Discount > 0, "With Discount", "Without Discount")) %>%
  group_by(State, discount_given) %>%
  summarise(avg_sales = mean(Sales, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 2: Pivot data to compare avg sales with and without discount
state_comparison <- state_discount_analysis %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = discount_given, values_from = avg_sales) %>%
  mutate(increase = `With Discount` - `Without Discount`) %>%
  filter(!is.na(increase)) %>%
  arrange(desc(increase)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)  # Top 5 states

# Step 3: Plot
ggplot(state_comparison, aes(x = reorder(State, increase), y = increase)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 5 States Where Discount Increased Sales",
    x = "State",
    y = "Increase in Avg Sales (With - Without Discount)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

2. Chart:  Average Sales With vs. Without Discount by Category
üß© What the code does:
Classifies each sale as either "With Discount" or "Without Discount".
Groups the data by category and discount status, then calculates:
The average sales
The number of records (count)
Visualizes the comparison using a grouped bar chart to show differences in average sales between the two discount statuses for each category.

SCRIPT:
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Use the dataset provided by Power BI
sales <- dataset

# Ensure numeric data types
sales$Discount <- as.numeric(sales$Discount)
sales$Sales <- as.numeric(sales$Sales)

# Group by category and discount status
category_discount_analysis <- sales %>%
  mutate(discount_given = ifelse(Discount > 0, "With Discount", "Without Discount")) %>%
  group_by(Category, discount_given) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_sales = mean(Sales, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n(),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Plot
ggplot(category_discount_analysis, aes(x = Category, y = avg_sales, fill = discount_given)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Sales with vs. without Discount by Category",
    x = "Product Category",
    y = "Average Sales"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("With Discount" = "steelblue", "Without Discount" = "orange"))

3.Chart: Average Profit by Ship Mode
üß© What the code does: 
Converts the Profit column to numeric (if needed).
Groups the data by Ship Mode and calculates the average profit for each mode.
Orders the results in descending order of average profit.
Visualizes the results using a horizontal bar chart.

SCRIPT:
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assign Power BI's internal dataset
sales <- dataset

# Ensure numeric data type for Profit
sales$Profit <- as.numeric(sales$Profit)

# Group by Ship Mode and calculate average profit
shipmode_profit <- sales %>%
  group_by(`Ship Mode`) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_profit = mean(Profit, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_profit))

# Plot the result
ggplot(shipmode_profit, aes(x = reorder(`Ship Mode`, avg_profit), y = avg_profit)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Profit by Ship Mode",
    x = "Ship Mode",
    y = "Average Profit"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

4.Chart: Correlation Heatmap of Sales Data
üîç What the code does:
Selects numeric columns only from the dataset.
Removes rows with missing values to ensure accurate correlations.
Calculates the correlation matrix using cor() to see how strongly variables are related.
Plots a heatmap using ggcorrplot():
type = "lower": shows only the lower triangle for clarity.
lab = TRUE: displays correlation values inside squares.
Color scale from red (negative) to blue (positive) shows direction and strength.

SCRIPT:
# The following code to create a dataframe and remove duplicated rows is always executed and acts as a preamble for your script:

# Assign Power BI internal dataset

# Select only numeric columns
numeric_data <- df %>%

# Compute correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_data)

# Plot heatmap using ggcorrplot

5.Chart: Monthly Sales Trend Line Chart
üîß Steps performed:
‚úÖ Loads and cleans the dataset:
Converts column names to lowercase for consistency.
Checks and converts Order Date to proper Date format.
üóìÔ∏è Creates a new column month_year by rounding order dates to the first day of each month using floor_date() from the lubridate package.
üìä Groups data by month and calculates total sales per month.
üìâ Plots a line chart with:
X-axis: Month-Year
Y-axis: Total Sales
A smooth line showing how sales trend over time

SCRIPT:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Assign Power BI dataset
sales <- dataset

# Print column names to debug if needed
# print(names(sales))

# Rename columns if needed (update based on your actual column names)
colnames(sales) <- tolower(colnames(sales)) # Make it lowercase to avoid mismatch

# Try using correct column name
if("order_date" %in% names(sales)){
  sales$order_date <- as.Date(sales$order_date)
} else if("order date" %in% names(sales)){
  sales$`order date` <- as.Date(sales$`order date`)
  sales$order_date <- sales$`order date`

# Convert and group

6.Chart:  Yearly Sales Trend Analysis
üîç What the script does:
üßπ Cleans column names to lowercase to avoid mismatches.
üìÖ Parses Order Date using multiple common date formats (ymd, dmy, mdy, etc.) with parse_date_time() to handle various date types safely.
‚úÖ Ensures Sales is numeric and filters out rows with missing dates.
üìÜ Extracts year from each order date and calculates total sales for each year.
üìà Plots a line chart with:
X-axis: Year
Y-axis: Total sales
Line and points showing how sales changed year over year
